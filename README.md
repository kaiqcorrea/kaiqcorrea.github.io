## 💭 About The Project

I am a beginner in web development and recently challenged myself to create my own version of the Linktree website. I am excited to share the outcome of this endeavor, which also happens to be my first open-source project. While working on it, I drew inspiration from two other websites to guide my design. Despite my foundational knowledge of HTML, I strived to achieve the best possible result. I look forward to further enhancing my skills as I continue to learn programming, as I believe this will lead to even greater improvements in my future projects.
